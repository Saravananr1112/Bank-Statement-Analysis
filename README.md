# Bank-Statement-Analysis
### About
I've been eager to analyze my bank statements ever since I started working with data analytics. It's a great dataset to start with because it's personal and familiar. When you analyze your own data, you often discover unexpected things, and this time was no exception. I began exploring my bank statements from the past four years.

### Getting Data
I downloaded the bank statement in excel format using online banking.

### Data Preparation
Using Power Query i did some data cleaning.

Promoted headers for ease of comprehension so you know what type of data contained in a column.

I have changed the date format and proceeded further.

### Data Analysis
I have performed the following steps for analysis purposes.
1. **Total Transaction Values:** The new column created allows for a comprehensive view of total transaction values, helping to understand the overall financial activity.
2. **DAX Measure for Analysis:** The DAX measure generated offers insights into specific metrics or calculations used for detailed analysis, aiding in drawing meaningful conclusions 
   from the data.
3. **Total Debit and Credit Amounts:** By calculating total debit and credit amounts, it becomes clear how funds are being utilized and where adjustments might be needed in budgeting or 
   spending habits.
4. **Category and Subcategory Breakdown:** Analyzing transactions by category and subcategory across different years provides a detailed breakdown of expenses or income sources over 
   time, highlighting trends and patterns.
5. **Number of Transactions:** Counting the total number of transactions helps in understanding the frequency and volume of financial activities within the specified period.

Based on the analysis results, I've identified my expenditure patterns and gained clarity on budgeting and planning for the future based on this information. The insights from the analysis have highlighted areas of spending and assisted in developing more effective financial strategies moving forward.
