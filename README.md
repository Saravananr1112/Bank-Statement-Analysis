# Bank-Statement-Analysis
### About
I've been eager to analyze my bank statements ever since I started working with data analytics. It's a great dataset to start with because it's personal and familiar. When you analyze your own data, you often discover unexpected things, and this time was no exception. I began exploring my bank statements from the past four years.

### Getting Data
I downloaded the bank statement in excel format using online banking.

### Data Preparation
Using Power Query i did some data cleaning.

Promoted headers for ease of comprehension so you know what type of data contained in a column.
